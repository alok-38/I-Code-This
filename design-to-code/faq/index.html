                            BankID is a digital identification system used for secure online
                            authentication and electronic signatures. It helps verify your
                            identity for various services.

                            You should only use your own birth number. Using someone elseâ€™s
                            may lead to issues or restrictions. In some cases, it could even
                            cause legal problems.

                            A password ordered by letter usually arrives within a few
                            business days, depending on postal delivery times. If it takes
                            too long, check with customer support. Delivery times may vary
                            based on your location.

                            To receive a password via SMS, ensure your phone number is
                            registered and request the password through the settings or
                            login recovery page. The SMS is usually sent instantly. If you
                            don't receive it, check your phone number or try again later.
